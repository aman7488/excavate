# Excavate
Excavate is a Data Science Hackathon organized in Composit 2022 (annual fest by Metallurgical Department), IIT Kharagpur

We have a given data from a renowned material science laboratory, recording data of 21,263 superconductors with 82 features. These features affect the Critical Temperature of a metal - the temperature at which a material transitions from a non-superconducting state to a superconducting state. Here, we identify the most important parameters affecting Tc and develop a predictive model that can accurately predict Tc based on these parameters.
